# Infix Postfix Machine

A React application that calculates postfix notation, converts postfix notation to infix, and converts infix notation to postfix.

---

### Description

<p>The Infix Postfix Machine essentially does three main functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Postfix Calculation</b> - Receives a postfix expression and performs a calculation.</li>
  <li><b>Postfix Conversion</b> - Receives a postfix expression and converts that to the equivalent infix expression.</li>
  <li><b>Infix Conversion</b> - Receives an infix expression and converts that to the equivalent postfix expression.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to performing these calculations and conversions, the Infix Postfix Machine also performs a step-by-step breakdown of each component of the process. This functionality is meant to serve as a learning aid.</p>
<p>The Infix Postfix Machine does have some limitations. These limitations are listed on each of the function's pages. For example, the postfix calculator can only handle the following operators: +, -, *, and /. Additionally, the postfix calculation rounds to the ninth decimal place. Please see each function's page for more details on input limitations.</p>
<p>The three functions use what is called "The Stack Method" to perform the calculations and conversions. I must give credit to Instructor Stephen Redfield and Instructor Eric Vogel at Oregon State University for introducing these concepts/methods to me.</p>

Technologies used:

<ul>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>React JS</li>
